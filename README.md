# TransradialProsthesisDevelopment2021
We're a group of university students with a passion for engineering and robotics. In this project, we are designing, programming, and building a prosthetic hand from scratch.

Electronic components used:
- Arduino Uno
- PCA9685 servo board
- MyoWare emg board
- Sg90 Servo Motors

Soon to come:
