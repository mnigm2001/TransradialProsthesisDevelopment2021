# TransradialProsthesisDevelopment2021
We're a group of 8 university engineering students with a passion for engineering and robotics. In this project, we are designing, programming, and building a robust and affordable prosthetic hand from scratch. We've completed our first design iteration using Electromyography (EMG) sensors and an Arduino to emulated real hand movement. Currently, we are pending publishing by The Meducator Undergraduate Journal, and we've begun modifications for the second design iteration.

Electronic components used:
- Arduino UNO
- PCA9685 servo board
- MyoWare EMG board
- SG90 servo motors

Soon to come:
- Full electronics schematics
- EMG data collection and translation files
- Complete grabCAD files
