# TransradialProsthesisDevelopment2021
We're a group of university students with a passion for engineering and robotics. In this project, we are designing, programming, and building a prosthetic hand from scratch.

Electronic components used:
- Arduino UNO
- PCA9685 servo board
- MyoWare EMG board
- SG90 servo motors

Soon to come:
- Full electronics schematics
- EMG data collection and translation files
- Complete grabCAD files
